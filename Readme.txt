Program has 2 main functions.
1. Creating shortest path graph from given input
2. Finding solutions to Traveling Salesman Problem using Breath First Search and Uniform Cost Search

Function 2 is not possible without doing Function 1 first.

We used Pyhthon as language and Visual Studio Code for platform. The code can be run and compiled using other platforms as well.

However, it is important to open the code with folder. If not, the code will not be able to see input.txt file.

At least it does not see it on Visual Studio Code.
